# Todo list app

An app made to quickly set tasks to be done.

## Progress log:
Added the task list functionality, now users can add their task by filling the entry with
text and clicking the "Enter" button, furthermore, they can delete the task and check the
CheckBox, so the Task is now functional, further testing required and polishing up of the
layout is needed, maybe use grid for the two principal components?
